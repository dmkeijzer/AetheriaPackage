'''
---------- EXPLANATION ----------
In these constants the unit is included and the definitiveness
(if that's a word) of the variable.
So an O means that this value can be taken as true, 
so for example the atmospheric constants won't change 
and the cruise speed has already been defined by requirements. 
An ~ means it's defined but maybe not needed and a ? means it's a guess.
